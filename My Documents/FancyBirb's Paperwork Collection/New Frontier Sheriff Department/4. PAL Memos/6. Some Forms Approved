[head=1]Memo[/head][/color]

Some of the forms you have submitted have been approved, while others have been denied. Processed copies of the approved form(s) will be sent to you shortly. The NFSD will also keep a copy for our records. Please remember any permits or agreements can be voided if they are abused. If you did not receive a copy of a form, you may assume that it has been denied. While the Sheriff is not obligated to share their reasonings with you, you may inquire via fax, holocall, or in-person as to what you might be able to do to be approved in the future. Please note that harassing the Sheriff, PAL, or anyone else about your denied form(s) will not be tolerated.
