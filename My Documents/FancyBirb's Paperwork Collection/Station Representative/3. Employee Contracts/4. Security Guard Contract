[bold]Communication[/bold]
As part of your job, you will receive access to the Service and Security encryption keys to be installed into your radio headset. Ensure that the Service and Security keys remain installed at all times, and make effort to pay attention to all messages communicated over those channels.

[bold]Expenses[/bold]
You may receive reimbursement for job-related expenses paid from your bank, at the discretion of the Station Representative. Covered expenses may include, but are not limited to: fuel costs, cost to purchase ship without a voucher, cost of job-related equipment and apparel, and the cost of food if no food is available in the Frontier Outpost staff break room.

[bold]Pre-Cryo Procedure[/bold]
While not absolutely required, performing the steps described in this section before entering cryosleep is highly recommended to improve the efficiency of the transition. First, ensure all job-related equipment is stored within the Security Guard Locker, or left with the Station Representative. Second, sell your ship, and if the cost of your ship was covered for you in cash, you may keep the value from the sale of the ship. Finally, report directly to the Station Representative to let them know you are entering cryosleep, and so you can collect your final paycheck if you have not already.
