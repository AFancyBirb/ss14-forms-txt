[color=Gray]This form assures that the requesting officer and the certifying official (which is the Head of Security, Captain, or Central Command Official that stamps this form), are certain that there is enough evidence and sufficient probable cause to call for the arrest of the individuals on this form. If a court comes to find the evidence to be grossly insufficient and for this warrant to have been approved when unreasonable to do so, both the requesting officer and especially the certifying official can be held liable. After this form is complete, ensure a copy is sent to the Head of Personnel's office.[/color]
