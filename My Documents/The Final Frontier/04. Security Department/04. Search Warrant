[color=Gray]This form assures that the requesting officer and the certifying official (which is the Head of Security, Captain, or Central Command Official that stamps this form), are certain that there is enough evidence and sufficient probably cause that would make a reasonable individual suspect evidence of a crime to be directly within the scope outlined in this warrant. If a court or greater authority comes to find the evidence to be grossly insufficient and for this warrant to have been approved when unreasonable to do so, both the requesting officer and especially the certifying official can be held liable. After this form is complete, ensure a copy is sent to the Head of Personnel's office.[/color]
