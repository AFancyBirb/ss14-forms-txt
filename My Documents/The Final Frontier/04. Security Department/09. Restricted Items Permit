[head=2]Terms and Conditions[/head][/color]

This permit grants the holder the legal authority to possess the specific items listed and use those items for the specific justification described. Violating the terms of this permit are grounds for this permit to be immediately voided. If this permit is voided, the act(s) that caused this permit to be voided and any further violations of these terms are not protected by this permit, and the individual may be charged with crimes from those acts. Abusing this authority, giving the items to unauthorized individuals, or using those items for a purpose outside the justification describe, are all illegal acts that violate the terms of this permit. Failure to turn in restricted items in a reasonably quickly manner after the permitted duration of this permit lapses is a violation of the terms of this permit.

This permit can be revoked for ANY reason by ANY of the individuals who have stamped this form, granting their authority upon it, as well as any superior authorities of those individuals. If this permit is revoked for reasons besides actions by the permitted individual violating the terms of this permit, then this permit protects all actions up to the moment the permit is revoked, granting the permitted individual reasonable time to turn in all restricted items. For this permit to be revoked, the revoking authority must verbally order the holder's copy to be given to them, then the revoking authority must within a reasonable timeframe fax a notice to all other authorities who have stamped this form that this permit was revoked. Afterwards, all copies of the revoked form must be collected and sent to the Head of Personnel's office to store in a folder that is labelled to indicate that all paperwork inside is considered void or nugatory, and the permit itself must also be relabeled to indicated its nugatory status.

Only Central Command has the authority to retroactively invalidate and void this permit for reasons besides any violations of this permit's terms and conditions. If Central Command voids this permit in this way, then the actions that were once protected under this permit are unprotected, and any items possessed or used can result in charges being pressed. However, it is up to the authority and decisions of Central Command whether to charge the holder of this permit, or to charge the authorizing individuals who have stamped this form, with greater recommendation being to only charge the authorizing individuals of this permit, and to grant clemency to the holder of this permit.
