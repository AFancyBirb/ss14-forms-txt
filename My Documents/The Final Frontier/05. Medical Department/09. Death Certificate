[head=2]Burial Procedures[/head][/color]

If the deceased did not leave a last will and testament that describes their preferred method of burial or chosen representative, then by default, their Department Head will be granted the authority to make decisions on their burial. If the deceased is a Passenger, the authority will fall to the Head of Personnel. If the deceased is a Command Member, the authority will fall to the Captain. If the deceased is the Captain, the remaining members of Station Command will decide with a vote. After the burial method is chosen, please mark the method below that is selected, then follow the procedures listed.

[bold]\[  ] Morgue & Return[/bold]
If this method is chosen, the body of the deceased shall be held in the morgue until the return shuttle is called. Once the return shuttle is called, all morgue residents are to be taken in body bags back to Central Command on the shuttle. From there, Central Command will be tasked with finding a permanent home for the deceased, or in handling the cloning of the deceased,

[bold]\[  ] Cremation[/bold]
If this method is chosen, the body of the deceased is to be incinerated, and their ashes are to be stored in an Urn. If no urn is available, another respectful container for the ashes must be chosen. The one authorized with selecting the burial method will then select themselves or another individual to be responsible for the possession and care of the ashes and the container.

[bold]\[  ] Recycling[/bold]
If this method is chosen, the body of the deceased is to be fed into a biomass recycler and processed into biomass. The biomass can then be used in compatible machines.

[bold]\[  ] Borgification[/bold]
Before this method is marked, please visit the Head of Personnel's office to ensure that a "Do Not Borg" order has not been filled for the deceased. After that has been confirmed, if this method is still chosen, the body of the deceased shall be gibbed by a medical professional, with a researcher from the Science Department present with an MMI receptacle prepared to insert the brain into. After the procedure, the researcher will take the MMI with the brain inserted to the Science Department robotics labs, and them or another researcher will create a borg vessel for the MMI. If possible, the borg should be sent to the deceased's original department to serve. 

[bold]\[  ] Spacing[/bold]
If this method is chosen, the body of the deceased is to be put in a body bag, and taken on the cargo vessel, or another suitable vessel to bring the body into space away from the station. Once the shuttle is a proper distance away from the station, the body is to be removed from the bag and taken off the shuttle, left to drift in space. The shuttle will then return to the station.
