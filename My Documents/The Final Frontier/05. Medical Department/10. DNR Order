If this form was requested by the individual named above, then this form only requires the Head of Personnel's stamp to be official.

If this form was filled for an unprotected individual (example: a non-crew anti-corporate entity), then this form requires either the Head of Security or Captain stamp.

If this form was filled as a result of criminal charges against a crew member, all of these stamps are required for this form: Head of Personnel, Head of Security, and Captain. This can only be done after a trial has been held, and the individual has been sentenced to death or Decorporealization.
