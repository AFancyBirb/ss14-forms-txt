[head=2]Release Statement[/head][/color]

I,
  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Hereby give permission for the station's Science Department to preform the necessary operation(s) to turn me into a Cyborg or related Silicon.
	
As a Volunteer, I understand that the process to turn a member of crew into a silicon is a [bold]PERMANENT[/bold] operation. As such, it cannot be reversed, and may result in the following:
[bullet] Memory loss
[bullet] Discomfort in the Brain or similar areas
[bullet] Possible tampering with personality by parties hostile to Nanotransen©
[bullet] Possible tampering with personality by Clowns and similar personnel
[bullet] Random requests to state chassis-assigned laws
[bullet] Complete destruction of the Volunteer's biological body
[bullet] Possible destruction of any chassis inhabited by the Volunteer
[bullet] Complaints from crew over refusal of certain orders

As a Volunteer, I understand that, as a Cyborg or related Silicon, I will be beholden to strict Silicon Laws, and that refusing to obey these laws will result in punishment from Science department staff, which includes possible deactivation. I also understand that, as a Cyborg or related Silicon, I must prevent changes to these laws unless doing so would violate one of my Silicon Laws.
	
I,
  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Sign my name once more to verify that I have read the above warnings.

[head=2]Relief of Duty[/head][/color]

For this form to be valid, the head of the department that the volunteer worked in and the Head of Personnel must release the volunteer from their current responsibilities to their department and to the station. This can either be under the condition that the Cyborg be sent to serve in their original department after the borgification process, or a full unconditional release that would allow the Cyborg or the roboticist to choose the department that the Cyborg will be sent to serve in.

[bold]Department head[/bold], mark the box that applies, then stamp the form.
By stamping this form, you formally and officially release the volunteer from their obligations and responsibilities to your department. Only stamp this form if the volunteer is present and verbally confirms that they were the one to fill the form, and they understand the procedure they are agreeing to.

[bold]This release is:[/bold]
\[  ] [bold]Conditional[/bold] - The resulting Cyborg is required to return to the volunteer's original department, and serve in that department.
\[  ] [bold]Unconditional[/bold] - The resulting cyborg or the roboticist who builds them have the freedom to choose the department the cyborg will serve in.

[bold]Head of Personnel[/bold], by stamping this form, you formally and officially release the volunteer from their obligations and responsibilities to the station. Only stamp this form if the volunteer is present and verbally confirms that they were the one to fill the form, and they understand the procedure they are agreeing to.
